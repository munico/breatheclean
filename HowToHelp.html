        <h1> What You Can Do To Help <h1>

          <p class="intro">Helping prevent and lessen the negative affects of air pollution (and global warming as a whole) is a group effort. However, we understand that it may feel overwhelming and at times a hopeless cause, given that a lot of the contributing factors that worsen air quality is out of our hands. This doesn't mean that we cannot help; in fact, there are countless ways that we as individuals and as a community can soften the blow our planet is recieving with each passing year.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Reducing Indoor Air Pollution</li>
                <p class="listexp">Indoor air pollution is caused by dirt, dust, or gases inside buildings that are harmful to breathe in. This can cause asthma, COPD, lung cancer, and much more. Building materials, air fresheners, pesticides, tobacco, household cleaners, and spray-on deodorant are a source of constant pollution. To prevent this, make sure not to buy more products than needed that help worsen your air quality. Always follow directions for use, storage, and disposal. Using a cold mist humidifier can help promote the growth of living pollutants, so make sure to clean the device regularly. Make sure never to mix cleaning supplies without checking double-checking the labels and istructions.</p>

                <li>Opt for Public Transportation</li>
                <p class="listexp">A seemingly cliche piece of advice given to lesson our carbon footprint, spending less time driving our personal vehicles and instead taking the bus, train, or subway can effectively reduce the amount of harmful gas leaking into the atmosphere. Public transportation produces far fewer quantities of air pollutants, like carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen oxides.</p>

                <br>
                <li>Turn Off Lights When Not in Use</li>
                <p class="listexp">The usage of indoor lights take up a lot more energy than you might think, contributing to the lack of air quality in the atmosphere. Make sure to always turn off lights you do not need, and turn it into a habit.</p>

                <br>
                <li>Reuse & Recycle</li>
                <p class="listexp"> Reusing our day-to-day possessions and recycling what we don't need contributes greatly to reduce pollution emissions. Recycled products take much less energy to make other products.</p>

                <br>
                <li>Trade Out Plastic Bags for Paper Bags</li>
                <p class="listexp">Using plastic products in general is detrimental for the health of our planet as a whole, namely the soil, forests, oceans and the wildlife. Plastic takes an extremely long amount of time to decompose because the material is made up of oil. Using paper bags instead is a much better and safer alternative--they compose easily and are recyclable.</p>
