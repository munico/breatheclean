 <h1>Who We Are</h1>



  <p class="space2"> The Breathe Clean Association was founded by the knowledge that those who live in less fortunate areas of the world suffer the most through air pollution--though most of the times it is caused by first world countries. A lack of resources, education, and inadequate healthcare puts these people under severe risk, and they have been left unprotected.  </p>

<h1> What We Aim To Accomplish <h1>

<p class="space2"> Our strive is to bring awareness to the detrimental affects air pollution has on the third-world, not just the humans but all other forms of nature. To do so we aim to organize fundraisers, petitions, protests, food-drives, voluntary work, and much more in order to help balance the scale of which our world is dealing with climate change. We are a non-profit organization, and all proceeds and donations are sent to those in need. </p>
